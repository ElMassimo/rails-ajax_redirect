Simple `redirect_to` support for AJAX requests in non-Turbolinks applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails-ajax_redirect'

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install rails-ajax_redirect

## Usage

Require `rails-ajax_redirect` in your `application.js`:

``` javascript
//= require rails-ajax_redirect
```

`AjaxRedirect` extends `redirect_to` to use a custom status code for ajax
requests, while still setting the `Location` header.

The script adds a handler for the `ajax:success` event, that navigates to the
location in the header for responses that have the custom status code.

Now you will be able to write controller actions in the usual way :smiley:

## Turbolinks

If your application uses Turbolinks check out [`turbolinks-redirect`](https://github.com/remind101/turbolinks-redirect), on which this library is based on. The advantage is that
it will perform faster navigation by leveraging Turbolinks to visit the new
location.
